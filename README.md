CG and MG Solve FPDE.
                Using the finite difference method to solve the Fractional order FHN model.
                We can get the numerical scheme with the first-order accuracy at time and space.
                Using the Conjugate gradient(CG) method and Multigrid (MG)method to solve the  linear system of differnce scheme.
